# SoarCalc Installation

The SoarCalc plugin is only available in the browser version of Windy.com.  Unfortunately it is not available in the Android/iPhone App.

For the moment this Plug-in is marked as “private” which means that it does not appear in the "Plugin Gallery".  The installation process is as follows...

1. Open Windy.com https://www.windy.com
2. Open the menu
3. Select “Install Windy Plugin”
4. Select “Load plugin directly from URL”
5. Enter this url: https://windy-plugins.com/12216047/windy-plugin-soarcalc/0.1.6/plugin.min.js
6. “SoarCalc” will now appear on the main menu.
7. It can be opened either from the main menu or more normally from the context menu (right
mouse on the map)
8. The pop-up window appears when you first open SoarCalc – you can close it directly or it
will be removed on the next mouse click on the map.
9. Windy.com opens by default in the “Wind” layer. But as the pop-up says, it works better in the
“clouds” layer so it is best to switch over to that.
